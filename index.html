            <blockquote>
<p>A really good article, even though it is old, but is really useful for every one. As a so-called “pet bioinformatician”, I learned a lot from this story. Every sentence in this page is worth to remember and keep in mind. Whenever I feel lonely or powerless, this stroy should be my light tower.</p>
<p>Thanks for everyone and keep working harder.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This may be a uniquely UK centric blog post but I suspect not.  Let me start with a brief story.  Sat with a coffee in our canteen a few weeks ago, I overheard a conversation between a few PIs about a grant application.  “Don’t worry”, the lead PI said,  “we’ve put money on the application to fund a bioinformatician”.  Good planning I hear you say, and I agree;  however,  note that none of the PIs in that discussion were themselves bioinformaticians; none of them can code;  put them in front of a Linux terminal and they wouldn’t know what to do.</p>
<p>Yes – we were witnessing the birth of yet another “pet bioinformatician”.  What I mean by this term is a single bioinformatician employed within laboratory based group. These guys are becoming more and more common in UK academic groups,  and it concerns me because it is possible they will become isolated and pick up bad practices as they don’t have a senior bioinformatician to guide them. It also concerns me that their career and profesional development might suffer.</p>
<p>Consider the opposite situation – how many bioinformatician PIs manage lab staff?  How could we possibly guide a young post doc on how to run gels, PCRs etc nevermind more complicated laboratory SOPs? We couldn’t – so why do lab-based PIs assume they can guide bioinformaticians?</p>
<p>Consideration has to be given to how you can develop and nurture a young or inexperienced member of staff when you have NONE of the skills they will need to develop to survive in their chosen field. How can you help them when you dont know yourself?</p>
<p>This guide is aimed at pet bioinformaticians, and is meant to guide them towards better career development.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Make friends with local bioinformatics groups</p>
<p>You may not be in the local bioinformatics group, but if there is one, seek them out, introduce yourself and make friends. Ask if you can attend their lab meetings and journal club. Tell the group leader you want to make sure you learn good practice in bioinformatics, and would like their help. If there isn’t one in your institute, where is the nearest one geographically? Can you travel to meet them? If so, do it; if not, attempt to skype into meetings etc. Develop electronic relationships with people and groups on the Internet. Develop a support group who will be able to help you with the kind of problems your lab-based group cannot.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Talk to your computing group<br>Find them, tell them what your work is about, what resource you will need and ask them how best to get access to those resources in the environment you exist in. If you don’t know what resources you will need, see point (1) above. Your local IT team will be essential to your sucess. Befriend the linux sys admin, they might save your life.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Obtain clear expectations<br>Speak to your manager and get them to outline exactly what their expectations are of you. If you are funded on a grant, get the grant application and read exactly what your manager has promised you will deliver. Prepare your manager for the possibility that their expectations may need to be altered, especially if they are unrealistic.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Rewrite your job description<br>Armed with (3) and with the use of (1) and (2), rewrite your job description, make your manager fully aware what you can deliver and what you can’t. Make them aware of how long things take, as they may not know. Do this as early as you can. If they disagree with your estimates of what you can deliver, ask for the support from (1). Give realistic estimations. Ask your manager to prioritise the objectives.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Papers</strong><br>You need <strong>first author</strong> papers, just like any other scientist. Middle author papers will only get you so far. Be up front about this, ask your manager where your next first author paper is coming from. <strong>Explain that, for certain projects you will have done more work than the lab guys, so deserve first authorship (only do this if its true)</strong>. If no possibility exists, ask to be allowed to develop your own ideas and publish those. Talk to the guys in (1).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Attend bioinformatics meetings<br>Your manager will want you to go to meetings relevant to the group’s research. Go to these, but also ask to attend bioinformatics meetings and workshops.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Try first, ask later<br>This is a delicate balancing act. Nothing will teach you better than just getting hold of some data or code and just giving it a go. Try. Sit and read and try as hard as you can to solve whatever problems you encounter. But be aware the solutions you come up with may be sub optimal. After a certain time period, ask for help. Show what you’ve done to those with more experience and ask for feedback. Take the best of what you have learned and any feedback you gained, and leave the rest behind. Noone likes the person who asks for help too early and expects someone else to tell them what to do; we all love a trier. But don’t take it too far; try your own way first, but at some point take a break and ask for feedback and assistance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ve seen more than one project where the results were almost 100% crap because a bioinformatician acted in isolation and didn’t ask for help. Don’t be that person. Don’t let yourself be. Being around other bioinformaticians should mitigate this risk, as they will be able to spot where you are going wrong before it is too late.</p>
<p>Make sure you are valued as highly as other members of your group, that your career is nurtured, that your skills are developed in the same way that other members of your group enjoy. Make sure you work to clear and realistic expectations, and take an active role in (re)defining your role and job description.</p>
<p>If you’re in academia, publish. Please publish. Mid author is ok, but first author is essential if you want to be seen as anything other than a facilitator. <strong>Aim for two papers a year</strong>. If your manager can’t deliver that for you, do it yourself. <strong>Publish a review. Publish a comparison of software tools. Take the problem you encounter most, solve it and publish the solution.</strong> It will seem daunting at first, but ask for help. You can do it.</p>
<p>Look after yourselves, pet bioinformaticians :)</p>
<p>Update – 24/4/2013</p>
<p>Wow, did this post touch a nerve – definitely my most popular post in terms of retweets and first day visitors.  There are clearly a lot of pet bioinformaticians out there!</p>
<p>A few things.  Firstly, if you are the PI of a pet bioinformatician, there is no explicit or implied criticism of you here.  There is nothing wrong with you employing a bioinformatician in your lab.  Just look after them, and recognise you can’t give them everything that they need.  You can give them a lot, just not everything.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is nothing wrong with being a pet bioinformatician – it can be a really stimulating role, and opens your eyes to lab-based science.  I am not criticizing the pets either, I just urge you to look after yourselves :)</p>
<p>Finally, this great comment from the tweetome:</p>
<p>…plus influence project direction RT @biomickwatson: A guide for the lonely bioinformatician wp.me/p1PnkE-3P</p>
<p>— Martin Humphries (@MJ_Humphries) April 23, 2013<br>I completely agree, if you can, you should be doing this.  <strong>Don’t be a passenger in lab meetings</strong>, suggest things that can be done, never forget you are a scientist too, you can propose hypotheses and how these may be tested :)  Your ideas are valid and you bring something to the party that no-one else in the room can.</p>
<p>Update – 30/4/2013</p>
<p>There is a possibility we could host a workshop in Edinburgh to look at best practices in “embedded bioinformatics”, involving some presentations, break out groups, and ultimately authoring a document/paper that highlights the pros and cons of the system.  This would either be free to attend, or would incur a very small cost to cover expenses (tea/coffee/lunch).  Would you come?</p>

            <h3 id="Quiz-1"><a href="#Quiz-1" class="headerlink" title="Quiz 1"></a>Quiz 1</h3><ol>
<li><p>An 𝚒𝚏 statement can have at most how many 𝚎𝚕𝚜𝚎 parts?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>1</p>
</li>
<li><p>0</p>
</li>
<li><p>Unlimited, i.e., 0 or more</p>
<p>The answer is <code>1</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Consider the Boolean expression 𝚗𝚘𝚝 (𝚙 𝚘𝚛 𝚗𝚘𝚝 𝚚). Give the four following values in order, separated only by spaces:</p>
<p>the value of the expression when 𝚙 is 𝚃𝚛𝚞𝚎, and 𝚚 is 𝚃𝚛𝚞𝚎,</p>
<p>the value of the expression when 𝚙 is 𝚃𝚛𝚞𝚎, and 𝚚 is 𝙵𝚊𝚕𝚜𝚎,</p>
<p>the value of the expression when 𝚙 is 𝙵𝚊𝚕𝚜𝚎, and 𝚚 is 𝚃𝚛𝚞𝚎,</p>
<p>the value of the expression when 𝚙 is 𝙵𝚊𝚕𝚜𝚎, and 𝚚 is 𝙵𝚊𝚕𝚜𝚎,</p>
<p>Remember, each of the four results you provide should be 𝚃𝚛𝚞𝚎 or 𝙵𝚊𝚕𝚜𝚎 with the proper capitalization.</p>
<p>The answer is <code>False, False, True, False</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A common error for beginning programmers is to confuse the behavior of 𝚙𝚛𝚒𝚗𝚝 statements and 𝚛𝚎𝚝𝚞𝚛𝚗 statements.</p>
<ul>
<li>𝚙𝚛𝚒𝚗𝚝 statements can appear anywhere in your program and print a specified value(s) in the console. Note that execution of your Python program continues onward to the following statement. Remember that executing a 𝚙𝚛𝚒𝚗𝚝 statement inside a function definition does not return a value from the function.</li>
<li>𝚛𝚎𝚝𝚞𝚛𝚗 statements appear inside functions. The value associated with the 𝚛𝚎𝚝𝚞𝚛𝚗 statement is substituted for the expression that called the function. Note that executing a 𝚛𝚎𝚝𝚞𝚛𝚗 statement terminates execution of the function definition immediately. Any statements in the function definition following the 𝚛𝚎𝚝𝚞𝚛𝚗 statement are ignored. Execution of your Python code resumes with the execution of the statement after the function call.</li>
</ul>
<p>As an example to illustrate these points, consider the following piece of code:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title">do_stuff</span><span class="params">()</span>:</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">print</span> <span class="string">"Hello world"</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="string">"Is it over yet?"</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">print</span> <span class="string">"Goodbye cruel world!"</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">print</span> do_stuff()</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Note that this code calls the function 𝚍𝚘<em>𝚜𝚝𝚞𝚏𝚏 in the last 𝚙𝚛𝚒𝚗𝚝 statement. The definition of 𝚍𝚘</em>𝚜𝚝𝚞𝚏𝚏 includes two 𝚙𝚛𝚒𝚗𝚝 statements and one 𝚛𝚎𝚝𝚞𝚛𝚗 statement.</p>
<p>Which of the following is the console output that results from executing this piece of code? While it is trivial to solve this question by cutting and pasting this code into CodeSkulptor, we suggest that you first attempt this problem by attempting to execute this code in your mind.</p>
<ul>
<li><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Hello world</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
</li>
<li><figure class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Hello world</span><br><span class="line">Is it over yet?</span><br><span class="line">Goodbye cruel world!</span><br><span class="line">Is it over yet?</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
</li>
<li><figure class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Hello world</span><br><span class="line">Is it over yet?</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
</li>
<li><figure class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Hello world</span><br><span class="line">Is it over yet?</span><br><span class="line">Goodbye cruel world!</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>The answer is </p>
<figure class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Hello world</span><br><span class="line">Is it over yet?</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>​</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Given a non-negative integer 𝚗, which of the following expressions computes the ten’s digit of 𝚗? For example, if 𝚗 is 123, then we want the expression to evaluate to 2.</p>
<p>Think about each expression mathematically, but also try each in CodeSkulptor.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(𝚗 - 𝚗 % 𝟷𝟶) / 𝟷𝟶</p>
</li>
<li><p>((𝚗 - 𝚗 % 𝟷𝟶) % 𝟷𝟶𝟶) / 𝟷𝟶</p>
</li>
<li><p>(𝚗 % 𝟷𝟶𝟶 - 𝚗 % 𝟷𝟶) / 𝟷𝟶</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The answer is <code>(n%100 - n%10)/10</code> and <code>((n - n%10)%100)/10</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The function calls 𝚛𝚊𝚗𝚍𝚘𝚖.𝚛𝚊𝚗𝚍𝚒𝚗𝚝(𝟶, 𝟷𝟶) and 𝚛𝚊𝚗𝚍𝚘𝚖.𝚛𝚊𝚗𝚍𝚛𝚊𝚗𝚐𝚎(𝟶, 𝟷𝟶) generate random numbers in different ranges. What number can be generated by one of these functions, but not the other?</p>
<p>(Refer to the CodeSkulptor documentation.)</p>
<p>By the way, we (and most Python programmers) always prefer to use 𝚛𝚊𝚗𝚍𝚘𝚖.𝚛𝚊𝚗𝚍𝚛𝚊𝚗𝚐𝚎() since it handles numerical ranges in a way that is more consistent with the rest of Python.</p>
<p>The answer is <code>10</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Implement the mathematical function f(x)=−5x[^5]+69x[^2]−47 as a Python function. Then use Python to compute the function values f(0), f(1), f(2), and f(3). Enter the maximum of these four values calculated.</p>
<p>The answer is <code>69</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When investing money, an important concept to know is compound interest.</p>
<p>The equation <em>FV=PV(1+rate)[^periods]</em> relates the following four quantities.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <em>present value (PV)</em> of your money is how much money you have now.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <em>future value (FV)</em> of your money is how much money you will have in the future.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <em>nominal interest rate per period (rate)</em> is how much interest you earn during a particular length of time, <strong>before</strong> accounting for compounding. This is typically expressed as a percentage.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <em>number of periods (periods)</em> is how many periods in the future this calculation is for.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Finish the following code, run it, and submit the printed number. Provide at least four digits of precision after the decimal point.</p>

<p>𝚏𝚞𝚝𝚞𝚛𝚎_𝚟𝚊𝚕𝚞𝚎(𝟻𝟶𝟶, .𝟶𝟺, 𝟷𝟶, 𝟷𝟶) should return 745.317442824</p>
<p>The answer is <code>1061.83480113</code>.</p>

<li><p>There are several ways to calculate the area of a regular polygon. Given the number of sides, n, and the length of each side, s, the polygon’s area is</p>
<p>x = ns[^2]/4*tan(π/n)</p>
<p>For example, a regular polygon with 5 sides, each of length 7 inches, has area 84.3033926289 square inches.</p>
<p>Write a function that calculates the area of a regular polygon, given the number of sides and length of each side. Submit the area of a regular polygon with 7 sides each of length 3 inches. Enter a number (and not the units) with at least four digits of precision after the decimal point.</p>
<p>Note that the use of inches as the unit of measurement in these examples is arbitrary. Python only keeps track of the numerical values, not the units.</p>

            <h3 id="Project"><a href="#Project" class="headerlink" title="Project"></a>Project</h3><p>The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.</p>
<p>One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones" target="_blank" rel="external">http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones</a></p>
<p>Here are the data for the project:</p>
<p><a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip" target="_blank" rel="external">https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip</a></p>
<p>You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set</p>
</li>
<li><p>Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.</p>
</li>
<li>From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.</li>
</ol>
<p>Good Luck!</p>

<h2 id="Chit-Chat"><a href="#Chit-Chat" class="headerlink" title="Chit Chat"></a>Chit Chat</h2><p>There are several tags of my blog, like “study” is for write down the process during my study, “Work” is for record the work experiences, “life” is for some little stories in my daily life, etc.</p>
<p>Blog is not only for post everything online, but for control my study and life in my Ph.D period.</p>
